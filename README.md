# finalCapstone
This is a collection of my capstone projects. Each folder contains a project that I have completed during the Python Data Science Course of HyperionDev CoGrammar. They have the following attributes:

- My project name.

- A clear, short, and to the point description of my project. The description describes
the importance of my project, and what it does.

- A table of contents to allow other people to quickly navigate
especially long or detailed READMEs.

- An installation section that tells other users how to install my project
locally.

- A usage section that instructs others on how to use my project after
theyâ€™ve installed it. Include screenshots of my project in action.

- A section for credits that highlights and links to the authors of my
project if that has been created by our team.
